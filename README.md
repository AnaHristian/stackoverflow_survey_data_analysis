## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using the last five years of Stack Overflow data from 2016-2020 to better understand:

1. How happy are developers about their jobs?
2. Where do most developers live?
3. How happy are software developers from the top three countries?
4. How important is it for our findings to have a clean dataset?

You can see al of the analysis here, in the Jupyter Notebooks.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 2 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://anahristian.medium.com/how-happy-are-developers-about-their-jobs-and-where-do-they-live-e503f4331654).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
